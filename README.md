## Description
This project is a simple and interactive password generator app for Google Chrome browser. User will be prompted to select the length of their desired password and to choose what charcters to include in it (lower case, upper case, numbers and/or special characters). The objective is to help the end user generate a secure password string based on their preference for length and characters thus helping them keep their private information safe.


## Usage
The Password_generator is deployed via GitHub pages and can be accessed at [https://boocipher.github.io/Password_generator/](https://boocipher.github.io/Password_generator/). Just hit the **Generate Password** button and follow the prompts.
<br> Below are some screenshots of the page, some of the prompts that the user will get as well as an example of a generated password as a result.
